some website video crawler
I am going to make some scripts for getting links of videos for its keywords written by user.
When we got the links, we can download those videos from those links, and make use of them to make a dataset or other things.
plan to support: like youtube, bilibili, tiktok and so on, later when i finish one i will write them down.
1. - [âˆš]. youtube
2. - [ ]. bilibili
